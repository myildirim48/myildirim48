### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  I'm currently learing Swift. <br>
  I am a computer programming graduate <br>
  I'm here to learn how to fish, not to buy fish like in my profile photo ðŸ˜„ <br>
  I am improving myself to become an iOS Developer. I do not have a professional work experience in the software field but i am fast learner and a highly motivated person.
