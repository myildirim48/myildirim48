### Hi there 👋

  🧑🏼‍🏫 I am a computer programming graduate <br>
  📬 muhammedyildirim48@gmail.com <br>
 
I have been working on refining my Swift knowledge and currently aiming to become an iOS developer. I am a curious person and always strive to know more about anything that has a rational value to me. Although i do not have any professional work experience on the field of software programming, I consider myself quite a fast learner and I am a very motivated person. As an area that I very much enjoy, I want to absorb as much knowledge as possible and be a vanguard in this field. I am always looking up to the frontier of technology and software development and aim to become on that frontier one day.
