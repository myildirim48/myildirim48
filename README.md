### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  I'm currently learing Swift. <br>
  I am a computer programming graduate and after my graduation I started to be interested in software again.
  To be an iOS developer, I'm learning swift, I've been developing myself with swift for about 4 months. You can see some of the apps I've developed in my profile.
